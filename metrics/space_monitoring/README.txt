# ================
# The CMS Space Monitoring Project was initiated by computing/offline
# management to provide a experiment/collaboration wide view of how
# disk space is used.

#
# The project developed tools to collect, store and display disk space
# usage information and requires sites to report usage information.
# For the deployment the Site Support Team setup a metric in the CMS
# dashboard to show reports of usage information. Scripts/utilities
# for the metric are in this area.

# space_mon.sh   Bourne shell script to query the Data and Workload
#                Management, DMWM, monitoring web service and extract
#                the last update time stamp for each site.
